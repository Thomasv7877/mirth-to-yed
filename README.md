# Usage

1. Take full Mirth configuration export, place in the 'in' folder.  
2. Run `mirth-to-yed.ps1` to generate a Yed diagram (xgml format), additionally, run `yed-to-md.ps1` to generate a list of channel groups, channel names and descriptions in markdown format.  
3. Open the xgml in Yed, auto organise the elements, 'one-click-layout''gives the best result.
